# Final Project integration

 I have created a clothing ecommerce website where the data is being fetched from the database and the users can add the products to the cart and place an order and check out. They can also create a user account. Here is the project structure;
 
To Run the Front end of the app, open the terminal and enter 
>npm i
>npm start

To Run the back end, 
>nodemon app

- *database (MongoDB Atlas)*
- *server (nodejs express)*
- *client (react web application)*
